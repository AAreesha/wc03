\titledquestion{Operation F}

  Let us define a unary operation, $F$, on languages as follows.
  
  \begin{mdframed}
    $F(L) = \{ f(w) \mid w\in L\}$ where, given
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $w=w_1w_2w_3\ldots w_n$, and
    \item each $w_i\in\Sigma$,
    \end{itemize}
    $f(w) = w_nw_{n-1}w_{n-2}\ldots w_1$.
  \end{mdframed}

  Prove or disprove that the class of regular languages is closed under $F$.

  \begin{solution}
    \\
    Lets assume there is a regular language L that is recognized by a finite automaton called M.
    \\ 
    In terms of mathematical notation: \\
    M = $\{Q,\sum,q,\delta,F\}$
    \\ \\
    Let x be a string accepted by M. If we put this string the above function, we will obtain a reversed form of it.
    \\ \\
    If all the strings accepted by M are reversed we will obtain a new language F(L).
    \\ \\
    Now let's construct a NFA M' which recognizes F(L). We construct a NFA and not a DFA because the machine M has been reversed leading to the involvement of epsilon.
    \\ 
    M = $\{Q,\sum,q,\delta ',F\}$
    \\
    \\
